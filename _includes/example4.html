<h2>Pictured: The Students I Taught as a Peer Leader!<h2>
<p>A FASTrack Peer Leader is in layman's terms a classroom teaching assistant (TA). My job was to assist the professor and students of the course. In this above picture I had my students go around the Ole Miss campus and take pictures of certain locations to help them become more familiar with the campus.</p>

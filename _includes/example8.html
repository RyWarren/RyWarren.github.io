<h2>Pictured: Representative Gregg Harper and Me at DC<h2>
<p>I was honored with being Chickasaw County's ECM Representative in 2017. It awarded me the unique oppurtunity to travel to the state and national capitals and meet various congressmen. Later I was awarded the ECM Chairman Finalist Award where I placed among the top five youth leaders in the state.</p>

<h2>Pictured: My Valedictorian Speech<h2>
<p>Academics has been an integral part of my life since I was a child. I was Valedictorian and Star Student in highschool. I have a genuine curiosity for all things in life and my lifelong goal is to collect as many degrees as possible. I love to learn and to take on the next challenge!</p>

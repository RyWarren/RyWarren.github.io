<h2>The Lifechanging and the Lifelong Journey<h2>
<p>Once I returned to Houlka I gave myself a challenge. I challenged myself to run long distance and to one day run 50 miles continously in an Ultra Marathon. Until then I set myself smaller goals to work towards. As of writing this, I've already broken past my 5k, 10k, and half-marathon goals and I am currently training for my first marathon that I will attempt in the fall! </p>

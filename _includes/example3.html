<h2>Ole Miss Student Housing<h2>
<p>Working as a Community Assistant at Ole Miss taught me critical thinking skills, crisis management skills, budgeting skills, and interpersonal skills among many others. Nothing can replace the incredible yet ardous experiences learned from working this position and I cherish my memories of it dearly.</p>

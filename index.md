[//]: # (write a bit about yourself here)
**Hello!** I am a recent college graduate with a strong background in leadership and a keen interest in pursuing a career in data or financial analysis. This website serves as a platform for me to showcase my skills, experience, and enthusiasm for finance, with the ultimate goal of securing a finance-related job that allows me to utilize my leadership abilities and contribute to the success of an organization.

As you explore my website, you will find a comprehensive overview of my educational background. I hold a **Bachelor's degree in Economics from The University of Mississippi**, where I not only gained a solid foundation in financial principles but also actively sought out leadership opportunities. Throughout my academic journey, I consistently took on leadership roles in student organizations, such as serving as the Vice President of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity and working with a team of peers in organizing events and workshops for students. These experiences have nurtured my leadership skills, including effective communication, team management, and the ability to inspire and motivate others.

In the **Experiences** section, you will discover how my leadership abilities and other skills have extended beyond the academic realm. I have taken on various leadership positions in extracurricular activities, community involvement initiatives, and volunteer work. I have also taken on a number of personal projects throughout the years. These experiences have allowed me to develop essential skills such as problem-solving, decision-making, and strategic planning. My strong background in leadership positions me well to excel in a finance-related role that requires teamwork, collaboration, and the ability to lead and influence others towards achieving shared goals.
